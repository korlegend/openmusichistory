## Domenico Scarlatti (1685~1757)

Italian Composer
**Domenico Scarlatti** was one of the most original composers of the 18th century, best known for his virtuosic keyboard sonatas. Born in **Naples** in 1685â€”the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handelâ€”Scarlatti was part of a generation that stood at the threshold **between the Baroque and Classical eras**.

He was the **son of [Alessandro Scarlatti](scarlatti_alessandro_gia_il_sole.md) (1660â€“1725)**, a major figure in Baroque music and one of the founders of the Neapolitan school of opera. Alessandro was instrumental in shaping the Italian opera overture and the cantata form, leaving a lasting legacy in vocal music.

Unlike his father, Domenico devoted much of his career to **instrumental music**, particularly works for the **harpsichord**. His keyboard compositions reflected the stylistic transformation of his time and helped to define the evolving aesthetic of the **early Classical style**.

## Harpsichord

<img src="./harpsichord.jpg" alt="artwork" style="width30%;"  />

The **harpsichord** is a keyboard instrument that was widely used during the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Unlike the modern piano, the harpsichord produces sound by plucking strings with small plectra when keys are pressed. This gives it a bright, crisp, and delicate tone, though it lacks the dynamic range of the piano (i.e., it cannot play louder or softer depending on touch).




## Why Important

Domenico Scarlatti expanded the possibilities of keyboard music with his innovative and technically demanding sonatas. He laid the groundwork for the development of modern sonata form, influencing composers like Haydn and Mozart. His fusion of Italian, Spanish, and Arabic musical elements created a unique, timeless style that still inspires musicians today.
